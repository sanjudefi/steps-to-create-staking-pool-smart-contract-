# steps-to-create-staking-pool-smart-contract-

**Define the ERC-20 token contract:** You will need to import the ERC-20 token contract and define the interface to interact with it. This will typically include the functions for transferring tokens and querying token balances.

**Define the staking pool contract:** You will need to define the staking pool smart contract and include the necessary functions for staking, distributing rewards, and withdrawing stakes.

**Implement the staking function:** The staking function should receive the user's staked amount and duration, and transfer the tokens to the staking pool's address.

**Implement the rewards function:** The rewards function should calculate the rewards earned by the user based on their staked amount and duration, and distribute the rewards to the user's address.

**Implement the withdrawal function:** The withdrawal function should allow users to withdraw their staked tokens and rewards after the staking period has ended.

**Add access controls:** To ensure the security of the staking pool, you should add access controls to restrict the functions that can be called by certain addresses.

**Test the smart contract:** Before deploying the smart contract to the Ethereum network, you should thoroughly test it on a test network to ensure that it functions correctly.
